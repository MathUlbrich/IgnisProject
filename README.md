# IgnisProject

This system propose is soft simulate the Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS Ignis' behaviors with the same phrases used in the anime. 

At the moment only AI Ignis will be avaliable, but I expect to create the others Ignis in the future.

This project is in test phase.

## Issues

The project was not tested yet. This because of some problems with my computer, so it may be not working.
